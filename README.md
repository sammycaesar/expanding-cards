# 01 Expandable Cards

![Design preview for desktop](./images/screenshot)

In this project, I created a expandable card that allows one to show information in a beautiful way. It's a perfect way to showcase your best photos. üì∏ I chose photos from around Australia to showcase its beauty ‚òÄÔ∏èüê®

This project is built with:

- HTML5
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript

Process:
This small project used the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Javascript code allows the user to navigate between each expandable card to reveal imagary and reveal the title and paragraph if each card.
